                &emsp;Blue is a color that is seen daily by everyone in the world. It describes the
                color of the ocean, the sky, flowers, birds, and butterflies; along with
                several more meanings and interpretations. In modern English, the word
                blue is one of the 3,000 most commonly used words. The Oxford
                dictionary definition for blue describes an object as a color intermediate
                between green and violet. But, since it&#39;s such a common word, there are many
                other usages of the word. For example, a person can feel blue to describe
                sadness. There is also an entire genre of music called &#39;the blues&#39;.
                And &#39;the blue&#39; can be used as a noun to describe the ocean or sky. However,
                the word hasn&#39;t always meant what it means today, and has an interesting history.

                &emsp;The word blue is somewhat ambiguous in many languages and can be used to describe
                both the colors green and blue. In Japanese, for example, the word &#38738; (ao) means
                green and blue and is interpreted depending on the context of the sentence it&#39;s in.
                The word was introduced to Middle English from Old French bleu, which relates
                back to Old English &#39;bl&#483;wen&#39; and Old Norse &#39;bl&#225;r&#39;.
                The Old Norse word for blue was also used to describe the color black, which
                is very similar to the way it&#39;s used in Japanese. However, even though the
                word was inherited by Old English, the word bl&#483;c (black) was used to remove
                the ambiguity of the word blue. So, why was blue ambiguous in the first place?
                It was used to describe two entirely different concepts, which seems rather
                confusing. It&#39;s an interesting concept itself because the idea of describing
                or imagining a new color isn&#39;t really fathomable.

                &emsp;So, with the change of blue
                and the concept of its color, it might show how the people themselves changed
                throughout time. Maybe the word adapted because the people started to appreciate
                the color itself, maybe people hadn&#39;t perceived it as its own color, or maybe
                it was just a confusing word. Either way, it shows some change in the people and
                how their language corresponds. The word blue today isn&#39;t thought of much
                because it&#39;s so common. But, by looking into its history and seeing its
                evolution makes it much more notable.
